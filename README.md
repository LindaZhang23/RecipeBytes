# ü•™ Welcome to [RecipeBytes](https://lindazhang23.github.io/RecipeBytes/)!
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Meet Linda and George, the Recipe Bytes team
- Two wannabe SWEs just messing around
- Linda is neurodiverse, and hates the hassle and unnecessary stress assocated with cooking
- George has been cooking his whole life ands the cooking club at BC, and wanted a way to organize his recipes.

## üë©üèª‚Äçüíª So we made this Web App!
- In the coming months or even years, we will be trying to improve this project
- We want to make cooking fun, easy, and personable
- Cooking is not just feeding yourself, it can be de-stressing and fun if done right! 
- We hope the Web App eventually will allow you to fall in love with cooking!

# üöÄ Our Goals
- Learn and transition to Typescript for scalability and error detection. It's just... better!!!
- Migrate to MongoDB for better scalability
- Allow users to add custom recipes, make the workflow much easier and personable
- Add meal prep features
- Might switch to a better API service, or if we really have the time, write our own

## üî• This is a learning journey for me
I want to make this process fun and learn many things in the world of SWE. I will change my mind plenty of times, or get disappointed, but I will eventually come to moments that remind me why I picked CS -- the dopamine rush that I solved a problem, not only for myself, but for those similar to me who want to fall in love with cooking.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
